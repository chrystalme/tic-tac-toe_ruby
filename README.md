## How to Play

Tic tac toe is a 2 player game that involves players putting "X" or "O" in a 3 by 3 dimension board. The players choose between 1  - 9 where they would like their position to be. When a player has three consecutive slots in any direction horizontal or vertical and across, the player wins. If the entire board is filled and there is no 3 consecutive slots being occupied by the player's symbol, it is a draw.
